Time-independent perturbation theory - introduction
================================================================================

Very simple and straightforward introduction to the time-independent perturbation theory in the quantum mechanics field.

In this paper I very briefly introduce some basic quantum mechanics concepts, then I show how, starting from a system for which mathematical solutions of the Hamiltonian are known, it is possible to derive the main results of the time-independent perturbation theory.

I wrote this paper for my third-year exam during my bachelor's degree in physics at [Unito](https://fisica.campusnet.unito.it/do/storicocorsi.pl/Show?_id=a435_1819).

If you find any mistakes feel free to get in touch. I can't promise I will actually make any corrections, because since the time I wrote this I changed career and I now work as consultant software architect and developer for the web. Still, I would definitely appreciate any contributions anyway.
